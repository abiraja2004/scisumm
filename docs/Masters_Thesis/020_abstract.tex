We propose a pipeline for summarizing scientific articles.
The pipeline consists of a baseline algorithm, TextRank, to rank sentences within a document based on relevance of the words within each sentence.
To improve the selection of important sentences, each ranked sentence is then given as input to an SVM classifier to decide whether the sentence should be included in the summary or not.
The ROUGE results show an increase in the scores over the baseline and we also present an analysis of the why our algorithm performs better than the baseline.
