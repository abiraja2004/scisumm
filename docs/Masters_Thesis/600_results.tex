This section documents the results obtained from the baseline as well as the experiments conducted using the importance features to train SVM classifier as describe in Section 3.9.
The reuslts of comparision of the performance of the final pipeline with the gold standard have also been documented here.

Table 4.1 shows the ROUGE scores obtained by comparing the baseline (TextRank) algorithm with the gold standard summaries.
It also shows the ROUGE scores of comapring the summaries generated by the final pipeline with the gold standard summaries.
