In this report, I documented the research conducted by me along with my group to develop a pipeline for summarizing scientific articles.
The baseline was built using TextRank algorithm which is unsupervised and hence produces a output in the form of ranked sentences based on content overlap between sentences.
This output can be used for futher processing.

Experiments were conducted to build a classification model that can identify the importance of sentences within a document.
Different metrics were tried as features for the words and phrases representing the verb, subject and object of a sentence.
A novel metric was proposed which measure the importance of words with respect to the seciton that the sentence appears in.
The classification model build using this feature set was seen to perform better than the baseline.
The final pipeline was used to create summaries which were judged against gold standard and it performed better than the baseline.

An in depth analysis of this approach helped in understanding the strength and weakness of the feature set and the values.
This has helped in planning for the next phase in terms of deicding the improvements to be done to the features in the next iteration of experiments.
