It is widely accepted that discourses are com-
posed of segments and that the recognition of
segment boundaries is essential to a determina-
tion of discourse meaning (Grosz and Sidner,
1986). Written language has orthographic cues
such as section headings, paragraph boundaries,
and punctuation which can assist in identifying
discourse structure. In ,spoken language, into-
national variation provides essential information
about discourse structure. For instance, it may
be used to mark structural features of discourse
at the global level, such as segment boundaries.
Intonation also provides more local information
about relations among utterances within a seg-
ment, for example indicating whether phrases are
parenthetical. It can also help distinguish between
different interpretations of phrases that can func-
tion either as cue phrases that indicate discourse
segment boundaries or sententially to convey do-
main information. Finally, variations in intona-
tional prominence may be used to convey informa-
tion about the discourse status of entities referred
to by definite noun phrases and pronouns.
An understanding of intonational variation and
the ways in which it carries information about dis-
course characteristics of spoken language is impor-
tant for computer-based interpretation and gener-
ation of speech. From the interpretation perspec-
tive, this understanding may provide new tech-
niques for identifying discourse structure. From
the generation perspective, it would lead to more
natural synthetic speech, making it possible to
produce computer speech that is easier for people
to understand and less susceptible to misinterpre-
tation.
Three major challenges have faced researchers
attempting to discover the relationship between
intonational features and the structure of spoken
discourse. First, the collection of corpora of spon-
taneous speech has required the development of

new experimental methodologies. Whereas it is
straightforward to have the same text read by
many speakers, it is much more difficult to ob-
tain similar samples of spontaneous speech from
multiple speakers. Second, techniques must be de-
veloped to obtain reliable segmentations and la-
belings of the corpora. Because discourse struc-
ture is rooted in semantics rather than syntax, this
has proved more difficult than tagging corpora for
sentence structure. Third, measures of agreement
among segmentations must be designed. In this
area too, the semantic nature of discourse struc-
ture leads to a more complex problem than com-
paring sentence parse structures.
This talk will begin with a summary of pi-
lot studies that demonstrated reliable correla-
tions of discourse structure and intonational fea-
tures (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg
and Grosz, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1994).
It will then focus on a new corpus of direction-
giving monologues, the Boston Directions Corpus
(Nakatani et al., 1995a; Hirschberg and Nakatani,
1996). I will describe the methodology we devel-
oped to elicit fluent spontaneous direction-giving
monologues ranging over a spectrum of planning
complexity. Next I will describe the development
of annotation instructions used to train labelers
to segment spoken discourses (Nakatani et al.,
1995b) and will discuss agreement among segmen-
tations on the Boston Directions Corpus obtained
using these instructions. Then I will describe re-
sults of our analyses of the correlation between
discourse structure and intonational features. Fi-
nally, I will present a list of challenges for future
research in this area.
