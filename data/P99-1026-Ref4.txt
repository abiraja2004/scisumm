This paper proposes a method for incrementally understanding user utterances whose semantic boundaries are not known and responding in real time even before boundaries are determined. 
Since it outputs the partial result of understanding that is the most plausible whenever a word hypothesis is inputted, the response generation module can produce responses at any appropriate time.
Two systems were compared: one that uses ISSS (system A), and one that requires each speech interval to be an SU (an interval-based system, system B).
A statistical hypothesis test showed that times taken to carry out the task with system A are significantly shorter than those with system B."
