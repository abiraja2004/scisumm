This is an indication that the collocation between the argument and the preposition is more indicative of the core/adjunct label than the obligatoriness of the slot (as expressed by the predicate-slot collocation).
We define three measures, one quantifying the obligatoriness of the slot, another quantifying the selectional preference of the verb to the argument and a third that quantifies the association between the head word and the slot irrespective of the predicate (Section 3.3).
In order not to bias the counts towards predicates which tend to take more arguments, we define here N(p, s) to be the number of times the (p, s) pair occurred in the training corpus, irrespective of the number of head words the argument had (and not e.g., EhN(p, s, h)).
