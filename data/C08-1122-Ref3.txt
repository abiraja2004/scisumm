However, all previous methods extract keyphrases for a specified document based only on the information contained in that document, such as the phraseâ€™s TFIDF, position and other syntactic information in the document.
However, the multiple documents within an appropriate cluster context usually have mutual influences and contain useful clues which can help to extract keyphrases from each other.
The collaborative framework for keyphrase extraction consists of the step of obtaining the cluster context and the step of collaborative keyphrase extraction in each cluster.
The graph-based ranking algorithm is employed for collaborative keyphrase extraction for each document in a specified cluster.
