The marked argument is a core in 1 and an adjunct in 2 and 3.
The distinction between core arguments (henceforth, cores) and adjuncts is included in most theories on argument structure (Dowty, 2000).
Distinguishing between the two argument types has been discussed extensively in various formulations in the NLP literature, notably in PP attachment, semantic role labeling (SRL) and subcategorization acquisition.

We define three measures, one quantifying the obligatoriness of the slot, another quantifying the selectional preference of the verb to the argument and a third that quantifies the association between the head word and the slot irrespective of the predicate (Section 3.3).
In order not to bias the counts towards predicates which tend to take more arguments, we define here N(p, s) to be the number of times the (p, s) pair occurred in the training corpus, irrespective of the number of head words the argument had (and not e.g., EhN(p, s, h)).
In order to avoid tuning a parameter for each of the measures, we set the threshold as the median value of this measure in the test set.

We believe a better understanding of the differences between cores and adjuncts may contribute to the development of better SRL techniques, in both its supervised and unsupervised variants. 
We speculate the reason is that the head word disambiguates the preposition and that this disambiguation generally determines whether a prepositional argument is a core or an adjunct (somewhat independently of the predicate).
The algorithm applies state-of-the-art unsupervised parser and POS tagger to collect statistics from a large raw text corpus.
