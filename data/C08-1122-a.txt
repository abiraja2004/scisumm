Given a document cluster, CollabRank makes use of the global word relationships in the cluster to evaluate and rank candidate phrases for each single document in the cluster based on the graph-based ranking algorithm.
Instead of making only use of the word relationships in a single document, the algorithm can incorporate the “voting” or “recommendations” between words in all the documents of the cluster, thus making use of the global information existing in the cluster context.
All the candidate phrases in the document are ranked in decreasing order of the phrase scores and the top n phrases are selected as the keyphrases of the document.
