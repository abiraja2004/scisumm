The motivation for this paper is to discover which joining terms are good predictors of a semantic relation, and which learning algorithms perform best at the task of mapping from joining terms to semantic relations for modifier-noun compounds. 
We counted the frequencies with which phrases occurred between two nouns and chose the 28 most frequent of these phrases as our joining terms.
The SVM algorithm produced the best accuracy of all, achieving 50.1% accuracy using the combined set of joining terms.
