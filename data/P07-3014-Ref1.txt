One method for deducing semantic relations between words in compounds involves gathering n-gram frequencies of these paraphrases, containing a noun, a modifier and a 'joining term' that links them.
Some algorithm can then be used to map from joining term frequencies to semantic relations and so find the correct relation for the compound in question.
The motivation for this paper is to discover which joining terms are good predictors of a semantic relation, and which learning algorithms perform best at the task of mapping from joining terms to semantic relations for modifier-noun compounds.
The second approach is to use statistical information about the occurrence of the noun and modifier in a corpus to generate attributes for a machine learning algorithm.
The SVM consistently outperformed the baseline; neither of the other algorithms did so.
