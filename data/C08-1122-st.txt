The collaborative framework for keyphrase extraction consists of the step of obtaining the cluster context and the step of collaborative keyphrase extraction in each cluster.
For implementation, the initial scores of the words are set to 1 and the iteration algorithm in Equation (4) is adopted to compute the new scores of the words.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach named CollabRank for collaborative singledocument keyphrase extraction, which makes use of the mutual influences between documents in appropriate cluster context to better evaluate the saliency of words and phrases.
