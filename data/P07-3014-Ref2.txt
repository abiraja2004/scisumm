The motivation for this paper is to discover which joining terms are good predictors of a semantic relation, and which learning algorithms perform best at the task of mapping from joining terms to semantic relations for modifier-noun compounds.
The second approach is to use statistical information about the occurrence of the noun and modifier in a corpus to generate attributes for a machine learning algorithm.
We experiment with three different learning algorithms; Nearest Neighbor, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
The SVM algorithm produced the best accuracy of all, achieving 50.1% accuracy using the combined set of joining terms.
