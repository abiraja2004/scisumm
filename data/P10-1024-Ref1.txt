We define three measures, one quantifying the obligatoriness of the slot, another quantifying the selectional preference of the verb to the argument and a third that quantifies the association between the head word and the slot irrespective of the predicate (Section 3.3).
We continue by tagging the corpus using Clarkâ€™s unsupervised POS tagger (Clark, 2003) and the unsupervised Prototype Tagger (Abend et al., 2010).
Using these annotation layers, we traverse the corpus and extract every (predicate, slot, argument head) triplet.
The algorithm proceeds to integrate the predictions of the weak classifiers into a single classifier.
The prediction is determined by the majority vote.
It obtains an accuracy of roughly 70%.
