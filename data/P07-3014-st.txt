Choosing a set of joining terms in a principled manner in the hope of capturing the semantic relation between constituents in the noun phrase is difficult, but there is certainly some correlation between a prepositional term or short linking verb and a semantic relation.
For the first condition, the attributes used by the learning algorithms consisted of vectors of web hits obtained using the 14 most frequent joining terms found in the BNC.
There was almost no difference in accuracy between the first two conditions, and again using all of the joining terms produced the best results.
The largest class in our dataset is &quot;participant&quot;, which is the label for 43% of the examples; the smallest is &quot;temporal&quot;, which labels 9% of the examples.
