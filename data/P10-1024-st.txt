The marked argument is a core in 1 and an adjunct in 2 and 3.
We define three measures, one quantifying the obligatoriness of the slot, another quantifying the selectional preference of the verb to the argument and a third that quantifies the association between the head word and the slot irrespective of the predicate (Section 3.3).
This is an indication that the collocation between the argument and the preposition is more indicative of the core/adjunct label than the obligatoriness of the slot (as expressed by the predicate-slot collocation).
We believe a better understanding of the differences between cores and adjuncts may contribute to the development of better SRL techniques, in both its supervised and unsupervised variants.
