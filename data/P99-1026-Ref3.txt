This paper presents incremental significant utterance-sequence search (ISSS), a method that enables incremental understanding of user utterances word by word by finding plausible sequences of utterances that play crucial roles in the task execution of dialogues. 
ISSS holds multiple possible belief states and updates those belief states when a word hypothesis is inputted.
The response generation module produces responses based on the most likely belief state.
The method utilizes beam search to deal with the ambiguity of boundaries as well as syntactic and semantic ambiguities.
A comparison of an experimental spoken dialogue system using ISSS with an interval-based system shows that the method is effective.
