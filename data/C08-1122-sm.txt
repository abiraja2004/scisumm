The collaborative framework for keyphrase extraction consists of the step of obtaining the cluster context and the step of collaborative keyphrase extraction in each cluster.
Divisive Clustering: It is a top-down hierarchical clustering algorithm and starts with one, all-inclusive cluster and, at each step, splits the largest cluster (i.e. the cluster with most documents) into two small clusters using the Kmeans algorithm until the number of clusters increases to the desired number 30.
In future work, we will explore other keyphrase extraction methods in the proposed collaborative framework to validate the robustness of the framework.
