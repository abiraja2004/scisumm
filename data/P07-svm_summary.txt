The attributes used as input to the learning algorithms are the web frequencies for phrases containing the modifier, noun, and a prepositional joining term.
The motivation for this paper is to discover which joining terms are good predictors of a semantic relation, and which learning algorithms perform best at the task of mapping from joining terms to semantic relations for modifier-noun compounds. 
Turney and Littman (2005) use a set of 64 short prepositional and conjunctive phrases they call &quot;joining terms&quot; to generate exact queries for AltaVista of the form &quot;noun joining term modifier&quot;, and &quot;modifier joining term noun&quot;.
