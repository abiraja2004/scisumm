In this study, the cluster context is obtained by applying the clustering algorithm on the document set, and we have investigated how the cluster context influences the keyphrase extraction performance by employing different clustering algorithms.
CollabRank is implemented by first employing the clustering algorithm to obtain appropriate document clusters, and then using the graph-based ranking algorithm for collaborative single-document keyphrase extraction within each cluster.
The collaborative framework for keyphrase extraction consists of the step of obtaining the cluster context and the step of collaborative keyphrase extraction in each cluster.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach named CollabRank for collaborative singledocument keyphrase extraction, which makes use of the mutual influences between documents in appropriate cluster context to better evaluate the saliency of words and phrases.
We also find that the clustering algorithm is important for obtaining the appropriate cluster context and the low-quality clustering results will deteriorate the extraction performance.
