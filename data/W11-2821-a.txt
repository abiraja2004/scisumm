One explanation for these findings would be that people do whatever is necessary to achieve a desired level of performance, so that when provided with superior tools they achieve roughly the same result but with less effort.12 The drop in performance by the unorganised text group on question 1 might have been due to unfamiliarity with a sentence-list type of text (all participants answered question 1 first since questions were always presented in the same order).
A second possible objection is that the organised text is necessarily longer than a bare list of sentences; this point is tested in the study reported here, which suggests that organisation makes the texts easier to use, with no loss of performance.
