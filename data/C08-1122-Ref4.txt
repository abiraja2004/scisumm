In this paper, we propose a novel approach named CollabRank for collaborative single-document keyphrase extraction, which makes use of the mutual influences between documents in appropriate cluster context to better evaluate the saliency of words and phrases.
Given a document set for keyphrase extraction of each single document, CollabRank first employs the clustering algorithm to group the documents into a few clusters.
Experiments have been performed on a dataset consisting of 308 news articles with human-annotated keyphrases, and the results demonstrate the good effectiveness of the CollabRank approach. 
We also find that the extraction performance is positively correlated with the quality of cluster context, and existing clustering algorithms can yield appropriate cluster context for collaborative keyphrase extraction.
