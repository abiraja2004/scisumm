This paper proposes a method for incrementally understanding user utterances whose semantic boundaries are not known and responding in real time even before boundaries are determined
The method utilizes beam search to deal with the ambiguity of boundaries as well as syntactic and semantic ambiguities.
This paper proposed ISSS (incremental significant-utterance-sequence search), an integrated incremental parsing and discourse processing method that enables both the understanding of unsegmented user utterances and real-time responses.
A significant utterance (SU) in the user's speech is a phrase that plays a crucial role in performing the task in the dialogue.
User utterances are understood by finding a sequence of SUs and updating the belief state based on the sequence.
