Given a (predicate, prepositional argument) pair from the test set, we first tag and parse the argument using the unsupervised tools above5.
We also report results for partial versions of the algorithm, starting with the three measures used (selectional preference, predicate-slot collocation and argument-slot collocation).
The success of supervised methods stems from the fact that the predicate-slot combination (slot is represented in this paper by its preposition) strongly determines whether a given argument is an adjunct or a core (see Section 3.4).
The measures used are based on selectional preference, predicate-slot collocation and argument-slot collocation.
Non-prepositional arguments are invariably tagged as cores and out of coverage prepositional arguments as adjuncts.
