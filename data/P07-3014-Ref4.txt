One  method for deducing semantic relations between words in compounds involves gathering n-gram frequencies of these paraphrases, containing a noun, a modifier and a “joining term” that links them.
Some algorithm can then be used to map from joining term frequencies to semantic relations and so find the correct relation for the compound in question.
We experiment with three different learning algorithms; Nearest  Neighbor,  Multi-Layer Perceptron  and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
We collect web frequencies for queries of the form “head joining term modifier”.
The SVM  algorithm  produced  the  best  accuracy of all, achieving 50.1%  accuracy using the combined set of joining terms.
However, one issue with the SVM is that it never predicted the class “causal” for any of the  examples.
