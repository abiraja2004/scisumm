CollabRank is implemented by first employing the clustering algorithm to obtain appropriate document clusters, and then using the graph-based ranking algorithm for collaborative single-document keyphrase extraction within each cluster.
Given a document set for keyphrase extraction of each single document, CollabRank first employs the clustering algorithm to group the documents into a few clusters.
Given a document cluster, CollabRank makes use of the global word relationships in the cluster to evaluate and rank candidate phrases for each single document in the cluster based on the graph-based ranking algorithm.
In this study, the cluster context is obtained by applying the clustering algorithm on the document set, and we have investigated how the cluster context influences the keyphrase extraction performance by employing different clustering algorithms.
