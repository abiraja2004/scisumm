We assume that most users prefer an ontology verbalisation that is worded and organised like a naturally occurring text of the appropriate genre â€”i.e., an encyclopedia or technical glossary.
We describe here a generic verbaliser2 (applicable to any OWL-DL ontology with English identifiers/labels) which delivers its output (e.g., figure 1) in the form of an organised hypertext,3 akin to an online encyclopedia or glossary, and investigate whether this extra organisation makes the text easier to understand and navigate.
From our study comparing organised and unorganised texts, two main points emerge: first, we find no evidence that people viewing the organised text perform a navigation task more accurately; second, people viewing the organised texts found the task easier.
